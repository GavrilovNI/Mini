## Multiplayer
The game was targeting only multiplayer at first. But due to that s&box was still in development preview there were not a lot of players, so nobody was able to play this game. I added "I'm alone" mode that allows to play alone but only games that support it.

## Leaderboard
There is a leaderboard that counts your global winrate.

## Main goal
Main goal of this project was to create a game that seemed impossible to make s&box before due to the fact that you can't have 2 scenes running at the same time.
This game manipulates with prefabs to make an illusion of running different scenes at the same time.
I wanted to write the code so that I should not do a lot to add a new mini game. That was accomplished. Most time I spent to add new mini games was to create itÂ´s 3d part.

## Mini games
Currently there are 5 mini games:

### Block Run
Player spawns on top of platform of bunch of small squares each one of then will be broken after player step on it. Players lose if they fall from platform. The goal of players was to be the last one standing.

### Falling Blocks
Player spawns in small room without top of it. After game starts there are blocks starting to fall from the sky in random manner. The level difficulty increases with a time. Players lose if they get crashed under the block. The goal of players was to be the last one standing.

### Find The Way
Player spawns in front of bunch of squares that all look similar, but some of them kill playyrs if they step on it. Every x seconds game reveals a path to the another end of the platform. The goal of players was to get to the end before timer ends.
